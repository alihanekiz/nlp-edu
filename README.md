This repository contains my bachelor thesis project.

## Setup

Make sure to install every library needed, some of them are described in the requirements.txt file.

You also need to either manually setup a elasticsearch instance, or use the launch_es module by haystack. When setting up manually, make sure to configure the elasticsearch instance correctly. (port, nodes, etc..)

Furthermore you also have to install the haystack library question generation pipeline.
Here you can find a proper installation guide [here](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/installation). Make sure to check for compatibility beforehand.
